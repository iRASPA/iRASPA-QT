    // The input and output are in terms of vectors of ints to avoid
    // dependencies (although I suppose a public member struct could have been
    // used). The parameters are:

    // rects : An array containing the width and height of each input rect in
    // sequence, i.e. [w0][h0][w1][h1][w2][h2]... The IDs for the rects are
    // derived from the order in which they appear in the array.

    // packs : After packing, the outer array contains the packs (therefore
    // the number of packs is packs.size()). Each inner array contains a
    // sequence of sets of 4 ints. Each set represents a rectangle in the
    // pack. The elements in the set are 1) the rect ID, 2) the x position
    // of the rect with respect to the pack, 3) the y position of the rect
    // with respect to the pack, and 4) whether the rect was rotated (1) or
    // not (0). The widths and heights of the rects are not included, as it's
    // assumed they are stored on the caller's side (they were after all the
    // input to the function).

    // allowRotation : when true (the default value), the packer is allowed
    // the option of rotating the rects in the process of trying to fit them
    // into the current working area.
